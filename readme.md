# Rethink Plaintext Editing

This is our frontend coding challenge. It gives us a chance to see your abilities and how you approach problems. It is designed to give you unlimited creative freedom as you develop a solution. Feel free to use any packages/tools/etc. you'd like to edit text as elegantly as possible. There are a variety of different file types to experiment with as you see fit.

To run the challenge:

- FORK this repo
- Download forked repo and run `npm install && npm run dev`
- Open `localhost:3000` in your browser
- Enjoy

Once complete, please email us a link to your forked repo with clean, tested code. We will use Chrome to run it.

## Scope 
1. Interface to allow you to modify and view the updated file type.
2. Button to toggle between view & modify
3. button to add new file type, dropdown list for type
  - "text/plain"
  - "text/markdown"
  - "text/javascript"
  - "application/json"
4. Text editor to modify file type, save button uses existing write function to update state using hooks.

### Assumptions & Limitations:
1. Scoped application to a simple view, update and add function
2. Save changes in state only, no DB or local storage in solution
3. Limitation - not very familiar with react functional components & hooks, most react experience with class components
4. User Interface limited to CSS skills
5. Timing to research new technologies and complete the scope of the application.
